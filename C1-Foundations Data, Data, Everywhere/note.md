## Data perspectives:		

Six steps of the data analysis process:		

**Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act** 		

**ASK**: The analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis.		

**PREPARE**: It all started with solid preparation. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step.		

**PROCESS**: The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. 		

**ANALYZE**: The data analysts discovered that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction.		

**SHARE**: Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful sharing the report.		  

**ACT**: The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings. 		


## How data analysts approach tasks			

The six phases of data analysis  
The data analysis process helps analysts break down business problems into a series of manageable tasks: 

In the **ask phase**, you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be  answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the **ask phase**, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way. 

Next, in the **prepare phase**, you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions. 

The **process phase** is when you will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

The **analyze phase** is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

Next comes the **share phase**, when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R. 

Last is the **act phase**, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem. 


## Data Ecosystem  

Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.

**The ask phase**  
At the start of any successful data analysis, the data analyst:   

- Takes the time to fully understand stakeholder expectations   
- Defines the problem to be solved  
- Decides which questions to answer in order to solve the problem  

Qualifying stakeholder expectations means determining who the stakeholders are, what they want, when they want it, why they want it, and how best to communicate with them. Defining the problem means looking at the current state and identifying the ways in which it’s different from the ideal state. With expectations qualified and the problem defined, you can derive questions that will help achieve these goals. 


**The prepare phase**
In the prepare phase, the emphasis is on identifying and locating data you can use to answer your questions. In an upcoming course, you'll learn more about the different types of data and how to identify which kinds of data are most useful for solving a particular problem. You'll also discover why it's so important that data and results are objective and unbiased. In other words, any decisions made from an analysis should always be based on facts and be fair and impartial. 


**The process phase**
In this phase, the aim is to refine the data. Data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means:

- Cleaning data  
- Transforming data into a more useful format
- Combining two or more datasets to make information more complete
- Removing outliers (data points that could skew the information)    

After data analysts process data, they check the data they prepared to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting the details right. Accordingly, the data analyst will refine strategies for verifying and sharing their data cleaning with stakeholders. In an upcoming course, you’ll use spreadsheets and structured query language, or SQL, to clean data.   


**The share phase**
This phase is exactly what it sounds like: It’s time to share what you’ve learned with your stakeholders! In this part of the program, you'll learn how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective, data-driven decisions. In the share phase, visualization is a data analyst's best friend. So, an upcoming course will highlight why visualization is essential to getting others to understand what your data is telling you. In another upcoming course, you’ll learn how to visualize data with R. 

**The act phase**
The data analysis journey culminates in the act phase, when data insights are put to work. For you, this action involves preparing for your job search and having the chance to complete a case study project. It's a great opportunity for you to bring together everything you've worked on throughout this course. Plus, adding a case study to your portfolio helps you stand out from other candidates!

Variations of the data life cycle
Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.
