## Mathematical thinking:   
- Looking at a problem and logically breaking it down step-by-step.  
- Using mathematical thinking, you can break this problem down into a step-by-step process to help you find patterns in their data. There's a lot of variables in this scenario.    

## Six common problem types:  
1. Making predictions: using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future.   
2. Categorizing things: different groups or clusters based on common features.   
3. Spotting something unusual: data analysts identify data that is different from the norm.   
4. Identifying themes: takes categorization as a step further by grouping information into broader concepts.  
5. Discovering connections: data analysts to find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them.   
6. Finding patterns: Data analysts use data to find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again.   
        
- SMART questions:
    1. Specific: simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. --> information detail   
    2. Measurable: questions can be quantified and assessed.--> 4W1H that what, why, when, where, how  
    3. Action-oriented: questions help you get there.--> make easier understand a problem  
    4. Relevant: questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.--> give a detail of questions to solve   
    5. Time-bound: questions specify the time to be studied.--> limits the range of possibilities and enables the data analyst to focus on relevant data.  


- Data trials and triumphs  
    1. Data-driven decisions  
    2. Data-inspired decisions  
    3. A data analysis triumph  
    4. Data analysis failures    


## Working with stakeholders   

### Executive team   
When communicating with the executive team, it is crucial to recognize that they are high-level, strategic leaders with very limited time. They need the "headline news" and key conclusions of your project first, rather than the fine details. To communicate effectively, lead your presentations with the answers to their main questions and keep detailed information in an appendix for them to review later if they choose. Your project manager is a key ally in this process. They can help you understand the specific needs of the executive stakeholders and can assist in getting necessary approvals, acting as a bridge between you and the busy executive team. Don't hesitate to ask your project manager for guidance.   

### Customer-facing team   
The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization. These stakeholders have their own objectives and may come to you with specific asks. It is important to let the data tell the story and not be swayed by asks from your stakeholders to find certain patterns that might not exist.   

### Data science team   
Organizing and analyzing data within a company is a collaborative process that involves teamwork between data analysts, scientists, and engineers. Different team members often analyze separate aspects of a problem and then share their findings. By combining these individual analyses, the team can uncover a "bigger story" and generate more comprehensive insights than any one person could alone. A key part of a data professional's role is this collaboration to explore data from new angles.   

### Working effectively with stakeholders   
**Discuss goals** Stakeholder requests are often tied to a bigger project or goal. When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more. Start a discussion. Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants. Sometimes, a quick chat about goals can help set expectations and plan the next steps.

**Feel empowered to say “no”** When stakeholders make urgent or unrealistic data requests, you should feel empowered to push back or say "no." Stakeholders may not understand the time and effort required for analysis or may not have a clear goal. Instead of simply refusing, you should ask clarifying questions to understand their true needs, provide a respectful explanation for why the request is unfeasible, and discuss what can realistically be accomplished. By offering alternative approaches or negotiating timelines, you can help reset their expectations and guide them toward a more effective solution. Giving context for your decision is key to gaining their understanding and cooperation.   

**Plan for the unexpected** Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks. Then, when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process.

**Know your project** Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or reports, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. Get to know how your project connects to the rest of the company and get involved in providing the most insight possible. If you have a good understanding about why you are doing an analysis, it can help you connect your work with other goals and be more effective at solving larger problems. 

**Start with words and visuals** It is common for data analysts and stakeholders to interpret things in different ways while assuming the other is on the same page. This illusion of agreement* has been historically identified as a cause of projects going back-and-forth a number of times before a direction is finally nailed down. To help avoid this, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey. Stakeholders have many points of view and may prefer to absorb information in words or pictures. Work with them to make changes and improvements from there. The faster everyone agrees, the faster you can perform the first analysis to test the usefulness of the project, measure the feedback, learn from the data, and implement changes.

**Communicate often** Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects. Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Then use your notes to create a shareable report. Another great resource to use is a change-log, which is a tool that will be explored further throughout the program. For now, just know that a change-log is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. Depending on the way you set it up, stakeholders can even pop in and view updates whenever they want.
