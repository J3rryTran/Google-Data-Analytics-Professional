# C5 - Analyze Data to Answer Questions   

## Data Validation    
Data validation is a function within spreadsheets that allows you to control what can and cannot be entered into a cell. Its primary purpose is to standardize data input, especially when multiple people are collaborating on a single worksheet. This proactively ensures data consistency and significantly reduces the amount of data cleaning required later.   
- Creating Drop-Down Lists: You can provide a predefined list of options for users to choose from, similar to a multiple-choice question. This is the most common use. Example: In a project management spreadsheet, a "Status" column can have a drop-down menu with options like "Not Yet Started," "In Progress," and "Ready," ensuring everyone uses the same terms.
- Creating Custom Checkboxes: This provides a simple way to track binary states (e.g., yes/no, complete/incomplete). You can assign custom values to the checked and unchecked states. Example: A "Review" column could have a checkbox where checking it means "Approved" and leaving it unchecked means "Not approved."
- Protecting Structured Data and Formulas: You can set rules to reject invalid inputs that don't meet specific criteria. This prevents users from accidentally entering incorrect data types and breaking complex formulas. Example: If a cell is supposed to contain a date, data validation can prevent a user from accidentally typing text into it.    


### Processing   

- Logical and Calculation Checks: This involves verifying the integrity of the data through logical tests and calculations.
- Common Sense Checks: This involves testing the data against real-world expectations and business rules.
- Technical Integrity Checks: This involves validating data within the analysis tools themselves to prevent errors.
